# SpotifySocial
SpotifySocial is an app that uses your friends' music activity to find you songs and music buddies.

This single-page app has three primary features -

1. We find your quarantine music buddy by going thru your friends’ music and finding the similarity quotient between your and their music. This is recalculated every time you follow a new person.
2.
    - Quarantine Song of The Day - We go thru your and your friends' playlist, run a similarity check, and find the song of the day that would appeal to your taste the most.
    - New song your friends have been listening to - We go thru all your friends' music, and match it with your playlist to pick a song from a genre that your friends have been listening to, but you haven’t, and you have the option to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down. If you give it a thumbs down, we eliminate similar songs from future finds.
